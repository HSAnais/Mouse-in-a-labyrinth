# Mouse-in-a-labyrinth
An high school project made entirely in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio. Upon running, the program displays a labyrinth and the user must choose where the mouse sits (starting point) and then where the cheese is (ending point). The program calculates the minimum distance between the mouse and the cheese, highlighting it.
